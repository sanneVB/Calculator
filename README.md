Calculator project

Creating a calculator website.

Requirements:

- Must live inside a webpage, that means index.html + index.css + whatever you'd like.

- That webpage must be served with a simple http server ( use npx serve <directory>)

- The calculator does not have to do more than add/subtract 2 numbers. Numbers should be floats, not just Numbers.

- On the side, you should keep an history of all computations as they happen ( should not persist, only in memory is fine )

- Code should be uploaded to GITHUB
